        - 9. September 2008: Last test before Offical Test - All right.

        - 14. September 2008: Test because I added some functions.
            After Test: I added some news, pawno got crashed and
            Windows have been broken or what :D I fixed it and GM is
            ready to test. Now I need to get some new ideas ;)

        - 15. September 2008: First official Test! GM is very famous!

If you have any ideas, or you need help (not with your GM's, only with install or what, I hate when someone ask me "How I compile my gm?")
, write me:
E-Mail: homerjay@x-tras.net
ICQ: 479-541-027

So, thanks for download, for using or for ideas. And thanks alot to lames who stole it ;) (Don't forgot credits :P)

P.S.: I think my English is so good now, but if you found any mistakes - I'm so sorry ;)

By the Way: We are looking for some good scripters, because we are only three and I think only I'm scripting ;D Contact me if interested ;)

By the Way2: Script will be updated ever week, you'll found it on SA:MP Offical Forums, CZ/SK Forums (PawnoBox.Net) or our websites (X-Tras.Net).

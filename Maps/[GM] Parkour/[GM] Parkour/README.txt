-----------------------------------------

Put both files in your "samp022server.win32 > gamemodes" folder and then open your "server.cfg" file and if you don't already have it, add this line anywhere in the file on a new line: "gamemode0 parkour 1" with out the speech marks, or go in-game, login to RCON and type "/rcon changemode parkour".
Now run your server and have fun playing my mode!

¦ How to install JunkBuster ¦
+---------------------------+

>>> To install JunkBuster correctly, you must follow this steps. <<<

Step 1)
	Copy the downloaded folder "JunkBuster" into your folder "scriptfiles".

Step 2)
	Copy "JunkBuster.inc", "JunkBuster_Client.inc", "zcmd.inc","dutils.inc" and "Double-O-Files.inc" into the folder "include" located in
	the folder "pawno"

Step 3)
	Open your gamemode. Include "JunkBuster.inc" into your gamemode (#include <JunkBuster>).
	IMPORTANT: Include JunkBuster >>BEFORE<< all other includes!!!
	You use filterscripts? Include "JunkBuster_Client.inc" into your filterscripts (#include <JunkBuster_Client>).
	This is pretty important for admin scripts etc. where you can teleport players or give weapons.

Step 4)
	You are using a default admin system with for example levels? Not only RCON?
	You can link this admin system with JunkBuster.
	JunkBuster can't recognize your adminsystem so you must add a function.

	Function:

		public IsPlayerAdminCall(playerid)
		{
			if(PlayerInfo[playerid][pAdmin] >= 1)
				return 1;
			else
				return 0;
		}

	IMPORTANT:
	This function depends on YOUR admin system. The function above is ONLY FOR GODFATHER so you
	have to customize this function.
	If you do not add this function admin immunity will only work for RCON-admins!!!
	
	PS:
	JunkBuster is compatible with the default Godfather gamemode! (Tested)
	
Step 5)
	Compile your gamemode/filterscript and check for errors. If there are any errors or warnings and you
	don't know how to fix it, post it in the JunkBuster topic on forum.sa-mp.com.

Step 6)
	Start your gamemode, go ingame and login as RCON-admin. 
	Now type /jbcfg. A dialog will appear.
	Choose the listitem "Set a var". After you have done this
	you will see all JunkBuster variables with the current values. 
	It's the best you choose every variable. Double-click on a variable and a new
	dialog will appear where you can set the variable. There will be a description for every variable, too. 
	Read description for the chosen variable before you change it.
	After you have customized the JunkBuster configuration. Go back to the main dialog (/jbcfg) and 
	choose "Save configuration to file".
	
Step 7)
	Add bad words and forbidden weapons. To do this open "BadWords.cfg" in the folder "scriptfiles/JunkBuster".
	Add or remove bad words. Now open "ForbiddenWeapons.cfg" and add or remove weapon IDs. 
	Minigun (38), both rocket launchers (35,36) and flamethrower (37) are forbidden by default.
	Go ingame again, tpye /jbcfg and choose "Load configuration from file" to load the forbidden weapons and bad words.

Step 8) 
	Type ingame /jbcmds for more administration commands.

Step 9)
	JunkBuster is now ready to protect your server from spammers, hackers, cheaters and other noobs.
	If you find a bug, REPORT it in SA-MP forums in the JunkBuster topic.

Step 10)
	Have fun and feel saver.

Description:
'a_callback.inc' are a set of usefull callbacks which
might be usefull for certain types of gamemodes.

Principle:
It assumes all the money given by the player as
one variable and the money player has currently
as another variable.
                     If the amount of money
player has is less than the money server 
has given to the player, then that means that the
player has spent the money on certain places.
      if the amount of money player has is
greater than the money server has given to
the player then that means that the player has
recived money ingame somehow.

CallBacks:
OnPlayerUseTransfender(playerid,amountspent)
OnPlayerUsePaynSpray(playerid,amountspent)
OnPlayerEatFood(playerid,amountspent)
OnPlayerDrinkSprunk(playerid,amountspent)
OnPlayerUseAmmuNation(playerid,amountspent)
OnPlayerUseCasino(playerid,amountspent)

Note: If your server uses any filterscript,
then a_callback should also be installed
into the filterscript.

Description:
'crash.inc' is sort of extension with which
you can easily find when, what, and why did
your server crashes.

Principle:
It converts a script into a format such that
it can detect every function which is running
and logs it into a text file.

NOTE: This is not compatible with most of the
gamemodes.

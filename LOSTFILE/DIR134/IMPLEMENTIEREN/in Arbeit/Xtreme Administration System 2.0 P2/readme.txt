Well, Enjoy!


The bugs fixed in this patch include:
	- /CARHEALTH is now fixed.
	- Setting a level as 0 now makes it public.
	- Registration password length error is now based on the config variable.
	- /HEALALL and /ARMOURALL text bugs are fixed.
	- Restarting the server no longer resets the Commands.ini file.
	- /VR has been added.
	- Teleporting people to you and teleporting to people now sets the virtual world.
	- Giveme now sets the vehicle's virtual world.
	- Weather command removed.
	- Some minor system fixes.

If /GIVEME and /GIVECAR crashes your server after you restart the game mode, type:

reloadfs XtremeAdmin2

in the server console right after you restart the game mode next time.  Same rule
applies for the level bug.

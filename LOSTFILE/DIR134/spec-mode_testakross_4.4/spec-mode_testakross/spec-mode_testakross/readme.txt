Testakross Spectator Mode [Filterscript] v1.0     -------UPDATE No. 4.4 ------



[---------INFO---------]

With this filterscript, you can view/spectate other players on a server with /cam [playerid][zoom(1-3)]

In the playerid area, type the id of the player you want to view(key:TAB).
In the zoom area, type the zoom type you want to use from 1 to 3.
1 = camera close to player | 2 = camera is of medium heigh | 3 = camera is far from player

These can be changed in the configuration box in the script.
The camera refresh rate has been set to 1000 ms. This can be also changed.

Type /cam [playerid][zoom(1-3)]
Type /camstop to stop spectator mode and die
Type /camhelp to view in-game instructions


[-------INSTALLATION----]

Put the cam.amx to your filterscripts folder in your server main directory (If the folder does not exist,
make one.) Open your server.cfg file with Notepad and add this line: filterscripts cam. That's it!


[-------WHY USE THIS?----]

-If an admin is suspicious of somebody cheating, he can watch his moves and his health bar while being shot
-It is simply cool to use!


[----------NOTES--------]

I am dooing a remarkable effort these days  to fix as many bugs as possible these days.

I have updated the script many times, and i really think some or maybe all bugs are fixed.

You can freely use this in your server, but you may NOT copy or use exact parts of this script
without my permission.
